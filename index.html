                <p>NerdLab YYC, a Calgary community for feminist nerds in tech, needed a place to post news and house resources (including their Code of Conduct). I took their logo, and created a fun and functional website around it.</p>
                <p>Feminist and geeky icons, as well as the pink accent color complement the group's personality and interests. The website also encourages visitors to join NerdLab YYC's Meetup group, and  prominently displays the group's Code of Conduct.</p>

                <div class="portfolio-description">
                  <p>Every developer needs a weather app, right? Here's my take.</p>
                  <p>I wanted to create a basic weather app where visitors could see the weather in their current location, as well as other locations. I also wanted to provide a different experience based on the weather displayed.</p>
                  <p>I took this opportunity to learn HTML5 Canvas and I animated custom icon backgrounds for 14 separate weather conditions (28 including day and night conditions). I gave visitors the option to search for a city or use geolocation to look up the current weather. Visitors are given the option of seeing the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit. They are also given information on wind speed and direction, as well as humidity.</p>

                <div class="portfolio-description">
                <p>Learning to code can be a daunting journey for many people. For this project, I wanted to reate a Random Quote Machine that allowed visitors to click a button and receive a random quote about learning to code.</p>
                <p>I used jQuery to create a minimalist site dedicated to inspirational quotes on learning how to code. The quote generator gives visitors a random quote, allows them to check out the source of the quote, and also gives them the ability to tweet the quote (including a link to its source). </p>

                <p>PayLab Networks is a Calgary startup specializing in mobile payments for vending. They had a domain name and a website with one large image. They required a functional website for potential investors to read up on the company and get in touch with the company founder.</p>
                <p>Originally, the website was created using WordPress and hosted on Google App Engine. Later, the team requested the site be moved from WordPress to a static site. I hand-coded the finished product and set up the site to use a 3rd-party service for the email form.</p>
